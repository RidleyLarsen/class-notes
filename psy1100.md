### Categories of Human Development
  * Lifespan Development
  * Child Development
  * Gerontology - Study of Aging Process (50s/60s+)
  * Adult Development
  * Emerging Adulthood (Disputed phase. 18 - mid 20s/30s)
  * Multidisciplinary Field
    - Lifespan development is not just psychology/biology. It has neuroscience, nursing, social policy, sociology, anthropology, biology, genetics, epigenetics, history.
  * Milestones
    - On average, everyone goes through milestones like first walking, talking, Attachment, puberty, cognitive decline.
  * Individual Differences
    - On average, people are one way or another. Not everyone applies to the average and there are outliers.
  * Transitions
    - **Normative Transitions**
      - Transitions everyone goes through (for the most part). Infants: Pre-verbal to Communicating. They are predictable and we expect them to happen. In our culture, everyone transitions from elementary to middle school. Most people transition into marriage. Majority transition into parenthood.
    - **Non-normative Transitions**
      - Unusual or atypical life events. Very few people expect their children to die before them, but it can happen. Living through major earthquakes, hurricane katrina, experiencing terrorist attack, etc. Divorce is an atypical life event.

### Contexts of Development
  * Cohort: Age group we travel through life with. People who grow up at at the same age as you.
  * Baby boom cohort: Large numbers of older citizens after baby boom in 1946-1964.

### Phases of the Lifespan
  * Childhood
  * Adolescence
    - Late 1800s. Changes in education and social policy. After Great depression, no jobs for young adults/teens. 1930s added high school.
  * Emerging Adulthood
    - Added about 15 years ago. Age 18 or so. Pushing adult responsibilities back years. Longer school times (6 years on average to get a "4 year" degree.)
    - More time for exploration. Figuring out who you are and what you want to do.
    - Pushing back time to take on other adult roles. People generally delay what age they get married. In utah, average marriage age is 20-22. US Average is 26-28. Poorer people tend to get married younger and have less emerging adulthood.
  * Young old
    - People in their 60s and 70s.
  * Old-old
    - 80 - 100s.
  * Oldest Olde
    - 100+. More people than ever living after 100.

### ***Socioeconomic Status (Important)***
  * SES - Socioeconomic Status comes from three criterion:
    - Income
    - Education - Higher education in general correlates with higher income and better jobs.
    - Occupation
  * Developed World
    - Affluent Countries: US, Japan, Western Europe, Etc.
    - Still has poverty and people of low SES.
  * Developing World
    - Impoverished countries. Most of the continent of Africa is still developing. Questions to determine if a country is developing:
      * Do they have clean water?
      * High rates of poverty?
      * Access to medical care?
  * SES as a college student
    - Access to financial aid affected by SES.
    - Opportunities afforded by money can be unavailable during college (e.g. Art trip to Europe, etc.)

### Culture
  * Collectivist Cultures
    - Societies that their cultural values prize harmony. The most important thing is for people to get along and be obedient (esp. children). Close family connections. These are more important than individual achievement. Asian cultures tend to be collectivistic.
  * Individualistic Cultures
    - They prize independence. Thrive on competition and personal success. Education system is based on competition and individuals. US, Canada, Western Europe. The US is probably the most individualistic.

### Gender
  * A context of development across the Lifespan
  * Why?

### ***Theories of Development (Important)***
Theories are possible explanations for something. We may observe something and develop ideas about how they work.

  * **Behaviorism**
    - "Give me a dozen healthy infants... and I'll guarantee to take any one at random and train him to be any specialist I might select - doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief, and yes, even beggar man thief." -- (Watson, 1930, p.104)
    - The idea of whether we're shaped by nature or nurture. Behaviorism says it's nurture. Only what you can see. John Watson was a behaviorist; he was the first to talk about it. He says the environment (or how people are raised) are predictors of behavior. We can only study what we can observe.
  * Reinforcement
    - B.F. Skinner - Says we have a law of learning based on operant conditioning. "If you reward or reinforce a behavior that behavior will continue. If you punish a behavior, that behavior will stop."
    - Operant Conditioning
    - Skinner Box: Controlled pigeons by giving electric shocks based on what he did or did not want them to do.

 * Albert Bandura - Models in Development
 * Bobo Doll
 * John Bowlby - Attachment Theory - Attachment persists throughout the lifespan. Relationship with parents will affect types of attachment with other people.
 * measure of variability
 * Accomodation - gaining information "mom is mom", other women aren't mom, etc.
 * uri bon??
 * Developmental Method
  - Correlational Study
  - Naturalistic Observation - getting as close to natural situations as possible. Using this as a method for studying development.
  - Self-Reporting. Answering questions about yourself. 1 - Disagree Strongly, 7 - Agree Strongly.

### Correlation is not Causation!!!
