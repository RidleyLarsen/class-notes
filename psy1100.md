### Categories of Human Development
  * Lifespan Development
  * Child Development
  * Gerontology - Study of Aging Process (50s/60s+)
  * Adult Development
  * Emerging Adulthood (Disputed phase. 18 - mid 20s/30s)
  * Multidisciplinary Field
    - Lifespan development is not just psychology/biology. It has neuroscience, nursing, social policy, sociology, anthropology, biology, genetics, epigenetics, history.
  * Milestones
    - On average, everyone goes through milestones like first walking, talking, Attachment, puberty, cognitive decline.
  * Individual Differences
    - On average, people are one way or another. Not everyone applies to the average and there are outliers.
  * Transitions
    - **Normative Transitions**
      - Transitions everyone goes through (for the most part). Infants: Pre-verbal to Communicating. They are predictable and we expect them to happen. In our culture, everyone transitions from elementary to middle school. Most people transition into marriage. Majority transition into parenthood.
    - **Non-normative Transitions**
      - Unusual or atypical life events. Very few people expect their children to die before them, but it can happen. Living through major earthquakes, hurricane katrina, experiencing terrorist attack, etc. Divorce is an atypical life event.

### Contexts of Development
  * Cohort: Age group we travel through life with. People who grow up at at the same age as you.
  * Baby boom cohort: Large numbers of older citizens after baby boom in 1946-1964.

### Phases of the Lifespan
  * Childhood
  * Adolescence
    - Late 1800s. Changes in education and social policy. After Great depression, no jobs for young adults/teens. 1930s added high school.
  * Emerging Adulthood
    - Added about 15 years ago. Age 18 or so. Pushing adult responsibilities back years. Longer school times (6 years on average to get a "4 year" degree.)
    - More time for exploration. Figuring out who you are and what you want to do.
    - Pushing back time to take on other adult roles. People generally delay what age they get married. In utah, average marriage age is 20-22. US Average is 26-28. Poorer people tend to get married younger and have less emerging adulthood.
  * Young old
    - People in their 60s and 70s.
  * Old-old
    - 80 - 100s.
  * Oldest Olde
    - 100+. More people than ever living after 100.

### ***Socioeconomic Status (Important)***
  * SES - Socioeconomic Status comes from three criterion:
    - Income
    - Education - Higher education in general correlates with higher income and better jobs.
    - Occupation
  * Developed World
    - Affluent Countries: US, Japan, Western Europe, Etc.
    - Still has poverty and people of low SES.
  * Developing World
    - Impoverished countries. Most of the continent of Africa is still developing. Questions to determine if a country is developing:
      * Do they have clean water?
      * High rates of poverty?
      * Access to medical care?
  * SES as a college student
    - Access to financial aid affected by SES.
    - Opportunities afforded by money can be unavailable during college (e.g. Art trip to Europe, etc.)

### Culture
  * Collectivist Cultures
    - Societies that their cultural values prize harmony. The most important thing is for people to get along and be obedient (esp. children). Close family connections. These are more important than individual achievement. Asian cultures tend to be collectivistic.
  * Individualistic Cultures
    - They prize independence. Thrive on competition and personal success. Education system is based on competition and individuals. US, Canada, Western Europe. The US is probably the most individualistic.

### Gender
  * A context of development across the Lifespan
  * Why?

### ***Theories of Development (Important)***
Theories are possible explanations for something. We may observe something and develop ideas about how they work.

  * **Behaviorism**
    - "Give me a dozen healthy infants... and I'll guarantee to take any one at random and train him to be any specialist I might select - doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief, and yes, even beggar man thief." -- (Watson, 1930, p.104)
    - The idea of whether we're shaped by nature or nurture. Behaviorism says it's nurture. Only what you can see. John Watson was a behaviorist; he was the first to talk about it. He says the environment (or how people are raised) are predictors of behavior. We can only study what we can observe.
  * Reinforcement
    - B.F. Skinner - Says we have a law of learning based on operant conditioning. "If you reward or reinforce a behavior that behavior will continue. If you punish a behavior, that behavior will stop."
    - Operant Conditioning
    - Skinner Box: Controlled pigeons by giving electric shocks based on what he did or did not want them to do.

# Sep 1, 2015
 * Albert Bandura - Models in Development
 * Bobo Doll
 * John Bowlby - Attachment Theory - Attachment persists throughout the lifespan. Relationship with parents will affect types of attachment with other people.
 * measure of variability
 * Accomodation - gaining information "mom is mom", other women aren't mom, etc.
 * uri bon??
 * Developmental Method
  - Correlational Study
  - Naturalistic Observation - getting as close to natural situations as possible. Using this as a method for studying development.
  - Self-Reporting. Answering questions about yourself. 1 - Disagree Strongly, 7 - Agree Strongly.
  - Ability tests
  - Observer Reports
  - True experiement

### Correlation is not Causation!!!

# Sept 3, 2015

Benefits of self-reporting:
You get context of how a person feels about what you're measuring. Higher sample size because self-reporting tests are easy to offer and proctor.

Ability test is looking at someone's mental or physical skills. The most common ability test is an IQ test. You can also measure someone's jumping ability: ex. physical tests.

Observer reports are a way of collecting data. Asking people to report their observations. Eg. teacher reporting on child's behavior. Observers will likely tell their point-of-view of behavior. They may also have biases of their own that can be accounted for.

True experiments are the only way to determine causation. You have people volunteer to be in the study, then you randomly assign them to one of two or more conditions where something happens to them (one manipulation group, one control group). The modifier doesn't happen to the control group; their results are compared with the manipulation group to determine if the manipulation caused the effect.

### Methodological Concerns
 - Representative Samples
 - Cross-sectional Study
  * All data collected at the same time. Not a study over time.
  EG: Cross sectional study about self-esteem. Collected on the internet with thousands of responses. "I see myself as a very self-confident person." 1 - 5 agree/disagree.
 - Longitudinal Study
  Follow people over time.
   * Eg. study a group of children over part of the lifespan (30 years.)

### More Methodology
 - Quantitative
  * Self reports, when someone answers 1-5, the data can be mathematically analyzed. Some observations can be codified into a numerical scale that can be analyzed.
 - Qualitative
  * Interview people and get information not easily quantifiable. Data is analyzed, but not using mathematics.

### Conception
 - Ovulation
  * Releasing an egg from an ovary to be fertilized by a sperm. Ovulation happens around the middle of the cycle. EG: Day 14 of 28 Day cycle. Cycles can be longer or shorter, but 28 days is average.
  * Women are born with about 500 eggs. They are born with all of the eggs they will ever have.
  * High levels of stress can make conception difficult.
 - Fertilization
  * Eggs are only available to fertilize for about 12 to 24 hours. Sperm can live in the reproductive system for up to a week.
  * 500 sperm per ejaculation, about 200 make it past the cervix into the fallopian tubes.
  * Chromosomes
   - DNA - Deoxyribonucleic Acid
   - 23 pairs of chromosomes
   - X, Y Chromosomes

### Prenatal Development
 - Gestation begins
 - Germinal stage
  * Zygote - Single-cell fertilized egg
  * Blastocyst - Hollow sphere of cells formed during germinal stage. Preparing to be implanted in the female's uterine wall.
  * Implantation - Mother and baby's genes develop the placenta. Most common place of miscarriage - the implantation can beÂ unsuccessful.
  * Placenta - Process the mother's blood to send nutrients to the baby. Umbilical cord attached to baby from placenta.

### Embryonic stage
 * Happens after implantation.
 * Has the biggest impact on development and lasts from week 3 to week 8.
 * The developing cells are called an Embryo. It is very rapid development.
 * Every single organ the person will have is developed during this stage.
 * The circulatory system develops and the heart starts pumping.
 * The nervous system develops after that. Between 21st and 24th days, beginning of brain.
 * Almost all the neurons you will ever get develop during this stage.
 * Arms at day 26, legs at day 28 as well as indentation for eyes and ears.
 * Things that happen during the embryonic stage have permanent, long-lasting effects. EG: Something happens that disrupts arm development: person may only have one arm or deformities.

### Principles of Develompent
 * Proximodistal. Develops inside of body first, then outside. Internal organs before skin.
 * Cephalocaudal (Ceph - Head, caudal - feet) Brain develops before legs, toenails, etc.
 * Mass-to-specific sequence. Coarse to fine-grained development. More massive areas develop before specific details and small features.

### Cohort Effect
 Shared experiences in generations.

### Pregnancy

* Avg is 40 weeks, but +- 2 weeks for still average. Length of pregnancy varies a lot.
* 45% of pregnancies end in miscarriage. Almost all of those happen before implantation.
* Stress can cause miscarriage. Stress causes a lot of things.
* Obesity, drinking and smoking, being above age 40, can all cause miscarriage.

### Threats to early delivery:
* birth defects
* most are in gestation
* 90% of babies actually born are OK. Body is pretty good at filtering out babies that will have defects.
* Foreign substances interfere with the foetus and cause problems.
* Toxoplasmosis: Raw meat and cat faeces.
* Sensitive Period / Developmental Disorders

# Sept 15, 2015
### Chromosomal and Genetic Disorders
 * Chromosomal

   Usually you have too many or too few chromosomes. When this happens, the pregnancy will usually spontaneously abort. X and Y chromosomes determine sex of baby.

  - Down Syndrome

  An extra pair of chromosomes. Different range of severity with down syndrome. Flat face, upward slant to eyes, stocky and short appearance and a large tongue. Develops during embryonic period before the 25th day. Often they will have childhood leukemia and die because of that. Many people with Down Syndrome also develop alzheimer's in their late 30s - early 40s. Life expectancy of 58. Normal life span is 77-88. Younger parents (teens, early 20s) are more likely to have surviving children with DS; older women are more likely to conceive children with DS but they are more likely to spontaneously abort. 80% of kids with DS are born with mothers under 35. Not a known cause; it's not likely genetic. 5% are attributed to defective sperm in the father.
 * Genetic
  - **Single Gene**
   * Dominant Diseases - Only one parent has to be a carrier.
   * Recessive Diseases - Both parents have to be carriers and you have to have both recessive genes.
   * Huntington's Disease (dominant)
    - Fatal disease. Uncontrollable movements. Age 35 and die young.
   * Cystic Fibrosis (CF; recessive)
    - Most common single-gene disorder. Lungs start to excrete a substance and prevent breathing. 1 in 28 european americans are carriers of CF.
   * Sickle Cell Anemia (recessive) - Helps survival of Malaria. Most common in people of African descent.
   * Tay-Sachs Disease (recessive) Nervous system disorder. Mucous-fatty substance accumulates around neurons. Most common in Jewish population
   * Hemophilia (recessive) - Blood clotting disorder. Blood doesn't clot - no scabs or clotting of any kind.

### Interventions in Pregnancy
 * Ultrasound

   Taking an image of the foetus as it develops. Doctors use ultrasounds to date the baby. During the embryonic period, used to determine if organs and limbs are developing correctly.

 * Chorionic villus sampling

   Relatively higher risk than ultrasound. Catheter in mom's abdomen or vagina, get a piece of the placenta. Risk of miscarriage when introducing anything to the amniotic fluid. Getting genetic material to test for genetic diseases or other problems.

 * Amniocentesis

   2nd trimester. More risk than ultrasound, less than CVS. Use needle to get amniotic fluid during an ultrasound. Chance of an infection because the amniotic sac gets broken.

### Infertility
 * The inability to conceive after a year of unprotected sex.
  - can be caused by high stress in the female.
  - Half-and-half for who is infertile.
  - Increasing age contributes to infertility in women, less so in men.
  - Vaginal infections can contribute to female infertility.
  - Causes a lot of stress in relationships.
  - 3/4 of women in their 20s can conceive; about 1/4 can't. Only 1 in 5 can conceive after age 40.
 * Assisted reproductive technology
  - Hormone injections
  - In-vitro fertilization

  Fertilizing the egg outside of the body. Hormone injections then implanting egg into uterus. Higher risk of birth complications (9%). Relatively low success (1/3) from in-vitro fertilization.

### Birth Stages
 * Dilation and effacement
  - dilation - size of dime to small bowl or coffee cup. Illustration: o -> O
  - effacement - uterus gets thinner as it dilates
  - Contractions generally get longer and closer coming up to birth. Up to a minute long.
  - This is generally a very long stage of birth.
  - Early
  - Late - Dilated to 4cm to 10cm. Hospitals consider less than 4cm not labor.
 * Birth
 * Placenta

### Newborn
 * Apgar scale

  Done at 1 minute and 3 minutes. Looks at a baby's condition: heart rate, muscle tone (floppy, low tension in muscles, high tension), breathing rate, reflexes/responsiveness, and color.

 * Low birth weight

  Babies who are premature, generally. Before 37 weeks gestation. Less than 5.5 pounds. Most babies who are low birth weight are fine.

 * Very low birth weight

 Very premature, babies who are less than 3.25 pounds. Rushed to an ICU for care. Very low birth weight babies generally have developmental disorders. "There are burritos bigger than these babies." Treatments that help VLBW babies survive can have side-effects like disorders. Many have cerebral palsy or blindness.

 * Neonatal intensive care unit
 * Infant mortality in US

 One of the highest infant mortality rate in developed countries. WHO recommends 10-20% of babies born via C-section; in US the rate is about 33%. Some hospitals have much higher rates of C-section and those can complicate birth. US is more litigious than other countries. More younger pregnancies than other countries. Teen mothers aren't as good at caring for babies. More pregnant women have significantly less healthcare available.

### Brain Development
 * **Cerebral Cortex**

   At birth, 25% of infant's brain is developed. The brain has most of the cells it needs. At age 3, 75% developed. Age 5, 90% developed. Next development during adolescence. Very little brain development at and after adulthood.

   Brain volume quadruples in the first 20 years of life.

 * **Neurons**

  Basic unit of the brain. Has a cell body, nucleus, dendrites, axon, synapses.

    * Axons
    * Dendrites

 - **Synaptogenesis**

 Proliferation of new synaptic connections (Many synaptic connections are created.) Happens during infancy. They create connections for all their senses: seeing light, touching materials, smelling, etc.

    * Pruning

    Removing useless connections. Happens constantly. It helps the brain become more effecient by improving the signal-noise ratio.

 - **Plastic**

   The brain is malleable across the lifespan. It is not rigid and solid: it can be reformed and changed by stimuli. Stress and overstimulation can kill brain cells.

 - **Myelination**

   Happens in the first 2-3 years. Axons develop a fatty myelin sheath around it and insulates the neuron's signal. Babies need a regular fat diet for the first few years to help develop the fatty tissue in the brain.


### Eating
   * **Reflexes**
    Capacity or response that infant is born with. Automatic on birth. Theoretically reflexes fade over time. Some reflexes we thought fade away, we just didn't have a way to exercise.
     - Sucking

       Sucking on breast. Can develop a pretty good latch on a breast.

     - Rooting

       Finding nipple and latching on.

     - Gag

       Removing things from throat

     - Stepping and Startle Reflexes

       Holding a baby over a surface where their feet can lightly touch and they will make stepping motions. Same as if you hold them in water.

  * **Breast Milk**

    WHO recommends breast milk for first 6 months of life. Breast milk gives the baby exactly what it needs for development (right fat, carbs, etc.) As the baby needs more fat, the breast milk will contain more fat. Breast milk passes disease immunity. Breast milk helps babies stay alert because they have exactly the nutrients they need. Breast milk reduces gas problems significantly compared to formula-fed. Breast-fed babies generally have higher IQ.

# Sept 22, 2015
  * Crying
    - Serves to communicate babies' needs.
    - 6-8 weeks, key times babies cry a lot. Afternoon & Evening.
    - Responding quickly is the best way to prevent a baby from crying a lot in the future (being prompt.)

  * State of Arousal
    - What extent baby is ready and alert to the world.
    - Quiet Sleep: 8 hours
    - Active sleep: 8 hours
    - Drowsing: 1 hour
    - Alert awake: 2.5 hours - mostly observing.
    - Active awake: 2.5 hours - actual movement.
    - Crying: 2 hours

  * Sudden Infant Death Syndrome
    - Mostly in sleep. Probably aren't neurologically complete in mind, so breathing or heart stops.

  * Sight
    - Preferential looking
    - Habituation: Predictable loss of interest. Not getting startled at the same thing many times in a row.
    - Size constancy
    - Face-recognition and perception

  * Jean Piaget
    - Multiple, discrete stages of development
    - Primary circular reaction: Baby learning about own body. Learning by doing an action repeatedly during 1-4 months old.
    - Secondary circular reaction: Circular reactions that involve learning about the outside world.
    - Tertiary "little scientist" - 1st birthday. using body to manipulate objects and observe them. "putting cookies in the VCR."
    - Means-end behavior. Using means to achieve an end.

# Sept 24, 2015

Piaget - Stages of Development
0 - 2 years: Sensorimotor Period
 - 3 Subparts
  * Get to know their body: Sucking on fingers and toes
  * They start to grab things.
  * Tertiary: Little scientist. Interact with and observe the world. Learning cause and effect, and coordinating the first and second points.

 * Object Permanence
  * A-not-B Error
 * Critiques
   - Not entirely accurate. Some stages happen earlier than he suggested. Some infants are in secondary stage at 2 months old.
   - Capacities develop over time. Secondary circular reactions: Maybe in the morningÂ on a certain day, an infant couldn't grasp an object but they could in the evening.
   - Piaget describes the behavior but he doesn't necessarily explain it.
 * Information-processing theory
   - Critics of Piaget. They appreciate that piaget described what happened at each stage, but they want to know what actually changes and why.
   - Way of understanding information processing in humans.
   - Steps involved in development that we need to be aware of. There is a more fine-grained scale than just 3 stages of development.

### Speech (Important)
 * **(*)Understanding production gap**
  - Infants can typically understand before we can produce language.
  - Infants can understand language as early as 8-10 months. The first language they display is sign language or gesturing.
  - Infants can't speak at an early age because they don't have enough muscle development in their mouths (jaw muscles, tongue, etc.)
 * Cooing
   - Starts around 2 - 4 months. Babies who are born deaf will also coo verbally.
 * Babbling
   - Starts around 6 months. Alternating vowels and consonants.
 * **Gesturing**
   - Starts around 8 - 10 months.
 * Holophrases
   - First word around 11 months. A holophrase is one word that conveys the meaning of a thought or idea.
 * Telegraphic Speech
   - Pairing words together. "Me juice" -> I want some juice. "Mama play" -> Mother, please play with me.
 * Infant-directed Speech ("Motherese")
   - Elongated words, asking more questions. "Hiii baaabyyyyyyy." When we emphasize and highlight intonations, it helps the babies' language development.
 * Early Speech
   - Infants can learn as many languages as they are exposed to. EX: Girl who had parents who spoke 3 languages -> she speaks all 3.
   - Language develops proportionately to the amount they are exposed to it.
   - Talking to babies is the most helpful thing a parent can do for language development.

### Attachment (_Mega Important_)
<span style="color: red;">
    **(all of these bullet points are red)**
</span>

Attachment theory is considered a universal theory; it is applicable in all cultures.

 * John Bowlby & Mary Ainsworth
 * **Primary attachment figure**
  - Proximity seeking behavior
    * Seeking physical contact with a primary attachment figure. In humans, infants cry to get attention, reach out with arms, smiling and cooing.
  - Preattachment
    * First two months. Theoretically, a baby could accept anyone as a primary attachment figure. Their system is open to any adult who will care for them.
  - Social smile
    * Six weeks to 2 months - baby starts to smile.
  - Attachment in the making
    * Four to seven months. Closely linked to when baby starts crawling. They show preference to their primary care figure.
    * C.A.P.: Contingent, Appropriate, Prompt.
      - Contingent: When baby expresses a need, the caregiver responds to the need.
      - Appropriate: When baby cries, caregiver responds appropriately.
      - Prompt: Caregiver responds quickly to baby cries. Specifically, within 90 seconds during the first year.
  - Clear-cut attachment
    * 7 to 8 months. Very clear-cut primary attachment figure.
  - Separation anxiety
    * Around 8 months, babies will cry if the primary attachment figure isn't nearby. Lasts until around 18 months.
  - Stranger anxiety
    * 7 to 8 months. Any time a stranger comes near, children will attach closer to the primary attachment figure to ease their fear.

If Primary caregivers aren't contingent, appropriate, and prompt, babies can try to wait for a caregiver that is.

  - **Social Referencing**
    * Baby looks at primary caregiver's face to determine how they should feel about a situation. Mom happy --> Baby happy. Mom afraid --> baby scared.
  - **Internal working model (IWM)**
    * Model of relationship developed by 3 years old.

  Avoidant Attachment - Primary caregiver consistently unavailable.

### Assessing attachment
  * Mary Ainsworth
    - Strange situation
  * Classifications
    - **Securely attached (70%)**
    - **Insecurely attached**
      * **Avoidant (20%)**
      * **Anxious-ambivalent**
      * **Disorganized**

# Sept 29, 2015

### Temperament
Our characteristic, inborn way interacting with the world. Between childhood and adolescence, we start using the term "personality" instead.
  * Easy (60% of all babies)
    - Regular rhythmic patterns of behavior. Eg. hungry, sleepy, poop on a regular schedule. Tends to have a positive mood, but easy to sooth if upset.
  * Slow-to-warm (30%)
    - Tend to have low affect. Slow approach to new situations. They tend to be more fearful of new things- maybe anxious. Shy babies become shy people.
  * Difficult (10%)
    - Babies have disorganized, irrythmic patterns. Never hungry, sleepy, or poop at the same times. Very reactive emotions. Little things can set them off, and they are difficult to sooth when upset. Grumpy mood.

Ed Tronic - Researcher. Assessing a parent-child relationship before 12 months. Still-Face Experiment.

### Child Care
  * Arrangements
    - Parents/Relatives
    - Family day care
    - Day care center
  * Effects
    - Attachment
    - Behavior
    - Quality
    - Family Considerations

### Toddlerhood
  * Autonomy vs Shame and Doubt
  * Autonomy: Self-Governance.
    - Toddlers want to do things for themselves. If they aren't allowed to, they can develop shame and doubt.
    - Toddlers are working on separating from their primary caregiver. They will start to walk, are held less, and use the word "no" frequently (even if incorrectly). They want to do things for themselves, even if they don't have the ability to.

# Oct 1, 2015
  * Attachment: you will always have a type of attachment, even multiple. Attitudes that seem unattached are still a type of attachment.

  * Autonomy vs Shame & Guilt.

  * Goodness of Fit: fitting the child's environment to their needs.
  * Power Assertion: Parents using power and authority to control children. Usually doesn't work.
    - You can't force children to do these:
      * Sleep
      * eat
      * bathroom

# Oct 6, 2015

### Cognitive Development
  * Preoperational stage
    - **Conservation Tasks**
        Children use physical appearance to judge volume. If something appears to have more, then they believe it has more.
        - Liquid (Juice in different sized cups)
        - Number
        - Mass (Play-Doh. Two balls -> one ball rolled into a snake -> children say the one that appears bigger has more.)
        - Matter

  * Concrete Operations
    * Reversibility
    * **Centering** (preoperational): They center their attention on a physical aspect of something. In the juice study, children only looked at the height of the glass, not the width.
    * Class inclusion: Not recognizing that there are subclasses of objects. "show skittles + gummy bears and ask if they would like skittles or candy" -> not realizing that candy contains skittles AND gummy bears.
    * Seriation: Can't put things in order based on criterion like "longest to shortest". A person stays the same despite a different appearance. Woman cuts hair short -> young children think they are a boy.
    * Animism: Idea that inanimate objects are alive. Believe that stuffed animals need to eat, sleep, etc.
    * Artificialism: The idea that older people make everything in nature, like "Mom, make the flowers bloom." or making the traffic lights change.
    * **Egocentrism**: Perspective that their perspective is the only perspective. They believe that everyone is feeling or thinking the same way they are feeling or thinking. Egocentrism is lost when moving to concrete operations.

### Information Processing
  * Development of Memory
    - Sensory store. Most sensory information doesn't enter cognition; they are not aware of sensory experiences until it's relevant. Sort of like redis cache.
    - Working Memory: Information that is actively being processed or thought about. Holds about 7 +- 3 items of information. This is like RAM.
    - Long-term Memory: Long-term committing of memory items. Theoretically can be infinite; it doesn't have a definite cap. Any information can be committed to long-term memory, but the challenge of working with long-term memory is actually remembering it. This is ROM, but the needle on the drive is very slow and the platters aren't very fast.
  * Executive Functions
    - Rehearsal: Repeating information over-and-over.
    - Selective attention: selecting what you give attention to. Older children in the marshmallow experiment would fidget or look away (putting their attention off the marshmallow) while they were waiting.

### ADD/ADHD
Attention Deficit Disorder, or Attention Deficity Hyperactivity Disorder. This is a difficult diagnosis because there isn't a blood test for it, and some people have some symptoms but not others. There are brain differences in people who have ADD/ADHD compared to people without. 10% of 10 year-old boys are taking medication for ADD/ADHD.
  * Most common diagnosis for children
    - Mostly boys
    - Cause unknown.

### Language Development
  * Vygotsky: Belive that learning involves other people. We know this because if we talk to children regularly, they pick up language much faster.
    - Inner speech: Regulating our behavior by talking to ourselves. Inner speech doesn't start out as an inner monologue, it starts out as actually talking to yourself.
  * Overregularization: Apply the rules of plurals and tenses to the extremes. "She teached me; we runs; etc."
  * Overextension: Applying verbal labels too broadly. Young child thinking every small animal is a calf, instead of just baby cows.
  * Underextension: Applying verbal labels too narrowly. Young child saying cows are only the black and white animals we get milk from, not realizing Steers are also cows.


### Cognitive skills
  * Autobiographical Memories
    - Memories for their own experiences in their own lives. Most of us have our earliest memories after age 4. Maybe age 3. Children who have higher vocabulary have more access to their autobiographical memories.
  * Theory of Mind
    - First cognitive understanding. Around age 4. Understanding that other people have different things in mind and different perspectives. Parents can be very concerned because children develop lying because they try to tell you a different reality. Some research suggests that people with autism spectrum disorder have deficiencies with theory of mind.

### Social and Emotional
  * Emotion regulation
  * Externalizing tendencies: Dealing with emotions where you act on your immediate imuplses. Tend to act OUT -> behaving disruptively and agressively.
  * Internalizing tendencies
  * Self-awareness: Ability to observe our own actions and abilities with an outside frame of reference.
  * Self-esteem


# Oct 8, 2015

### Erikson
  * **Industry vs inferiority**
    - Middle-childhood. Kids want to do meaningful work and achieve goals. If they can do these things, they develop a sense of industriousness ("I can do things") or if they can't, a feeling of inferiority. ("I can't do things.")

### More on Self-Esteem
  * Narcissism

  * _Sympathy_
    - Understanding someone else's feelings. Feeling upset _for_ someone instead of upset _with_ someone.  Leads to more prosocial behavior.

    - Children are tested in non-native language
  * Deficient Schools
    - Larger class sizes

### Adolescence
  * **Puberty**
    - Children becoming sexually mature. Uncomfortable topic in the US. Children go through a growth spurt- a period of extra growing around age 10/11 in girls and 12/13 in boys. Development in the primary sexual glands, and start producing sex hormones.
  * Puerty rite: "coming-of-age" ritual related to some marker of puberty. eg. first menstruation. QuinceaÃ±era. Some cultures practice female genital mutilation which is terrible.
  * Secular trend in puberty. Century-long decline in average age of puberty for children. Once was 16-17, now closer to 12, maybe 10. One girl menstruating at age 6. High stress can start puberty earlier, as well as diets higher in fat.
  * Menarche: a girl's first menstruation.
  * Spermarche: a boy's first ejaculation of live sperm.
  * Adrenal androgens: programming puberty. Body hair, body odor, sexual desire.
  * HPG axis: (H)ypothalamus, (P)ituaritary gland, (G)onads. Hypothalamic hormones stimulate the pituitary gland, which releases more hormones in a feedback loop (H -> P -> H -> P)
  * Gonads
  * Testosterone: higher in concentration for males. Affects aggressiveness and sexual desire.
  * Primary sexual characteristics: elongation of penis and menstruation
  * Secondary sexual characteristics: hips widening, shoulders widening, voice deepening, breast enlargement, etc.

### Body Image
  * Adolescence
    - Physical appearance really matters to children in adolescence. Boys who develop sooner have less problems than girls that develop sooner.
  * Tied to self-esteem
  * **Eating disorders**
    - Anorexia nervosa
      * Diagnosis requires maximum of 85% of ideal body weight (by BMI).
    - Bulimia nervosa
      * Cycles of binging and purging. Eating very high-fat food, then eliminating it (vomiting, excessive exercise, laxatives.)

### Sex Ed
  * Watched a video from John Oliver about sexual education in the US. Sex ed is very limited for a large majority of students in America, esp. Utah. Teachers aren't allowed to teach about sexual activity, condoms, homosexuality, etc.
  * Views of adolescent sexuality have changed over time. Youth are recognizing that it's OK to make their own decisions.

### Intercourse
  The younger you go into puberty, the sooner you will start having sex. Lower SES is correlated with higher sexual activity because of poor nutrition, poor education, etc.
  * Late teens
  * Factors: low SES decreases average age of sexual activity. TV normalizes having sex.
  * Double standard
